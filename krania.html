            <p> <b> Krania is a headache and migraine pain tracking assistant. </b> </p>
            <p> I struggle with chronic headaches, which occasionally turn into migraines. At a certain point, I was starting to feel hopeless, that this is just my life and there’s no way out of it, but found that there was at least something about this problem that I could control — my environment. I started by tracking li festyle activities daily in a Google Sheet. I later realized that there were apps created for this purpose, but found that they didn’t provide the features I wanted, and didn’t have a very pleasing interface or experience. This is the root of my desire to build Krania.  </p>

         <h2>Overview</h2>
           <h3>Problem</h3>
             <p>Existing apps that help people track their pain and triggers are clunky in design, literally painful to look at, confusing to use, and do not provide simple to use features for tracking what might be causing users’ pain. </p>
           <h3>Solution</h3>
             <p>Krania aims to provide an interface that is easy to look at, navigate, and incorporate into a daily life with pain. With darker shades of color, green color tones, and the prevalence of shapes and imagery over text, I hope that using this app will become a tool for crafting a life with less headache and migraine pain.  </p>

           <h2>User Research + Competitive Analysis</h2>
           <p>Firstly, I was overjoyed to have a great response for this survey. Where on average I would get about 30 responses for my surveys, this time around I had 140 people respond to the survey, which provided me with invaluable information. It was also eye-opening in certain ways.  </p>
           <p>For one, I hadn’t realized just how much medication was out there to treat headaches and migraines, and how much of it people were consuming. </p>
           <p>I also had a feeling that were a lot of people out there feeling hopeless, but to get it in writing like this, in direct response to my questions, was certainly heartbreaking. </p>
           <p>Not only did this confirm that I was on the right track from a product perspective, but also from an empathetic solution perspective. </p>
