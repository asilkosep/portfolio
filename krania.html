            <p> <b> Krania is a headache and migraine pain tracking assistant. </b> </p>
            <p> I struggle with chronic headaches, which occasionally turn into migraines. At a certain point, I was starting to feel hopeless, that this is just my life and there’s no way out of it, but found that there was at least something about this problem that I could control — my environment. I started by tracking li festyle activities daily in a Google Sheet. I later realized that there were apps created for this purpose, but found that they didn’t provide the features I wanted, and didn’t have a very pleasing interface or experience. This is the root of my desire to build Krania.  </p>

         <h2>Overview</h2>
           <h3>Problem</h3>
             <p>Existing apps that help people track their pain and triggers are clunky in design, literally painful to look at, confusing to use, and do not provide simple to use features for tracking what might be causing users’ pain. </p>
           <h3>Solution</h3>
             <p>Krania aims to provide an interface that is easy to look at, navigate, and incorporate into a daily life with pain. With darker shades of color, green color tones, and the prevalence of shapes and imagery over text, I hope that using this app will become a tool for crafting a life with less headache and migraine pain.  </p>

           <p>Firstly, I was overjoyed to have a great response for this survey. Where on average I would get about 30 responses for my surveys, this time around I had 140 people respond to the survey, which provided me with invaluable information. It was also eye-opening in certain ways.  </p>
           <p>For one, I hadn’t realized just how much medication was out there to treat headaches and migraines, and how much of it people were consuming. </p>
           <p>I also had a feeling that were a lot of people out there feeling hopeless, but to get it in writing like this, in direct response to my questions, was certainly heartbreaking. </p>
           <p>Not only did this confirm that I was on the right track from a product perspective, but also from an empathetic solution perspective. </p>

Perhaps it didn’t need to be full dark mode, but at least something that would be easy on the eyes. </p>
            <p>From the user surveys, and just from talking to people that struggle with this pain, I learned that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>I need to have as dark of an interface as possible,</b> with a lower contrast (while still maintaining accessibility standards)</li>

        <h3> Usability Testing and Discoveries </h3>
        <p>The main tasks that I tested were those that we determined would be necessary for this product to serve its main purpose. This included:</p>
        <p><b>1. Logging headache or migraine pain</b></p>
        <p><b>2. Entering information in a daily log </b></p>
        <p><b>3. Determining a trigger to eliminate, and setting up a trigger elimination schedule</b></p>
        <p>Here again, I had to check myself and go back to my main mantras for this product:</p>
        <p><b>Is everything that I’m making the simplest form of itself?</b></p>
        <p><b>Can it be easier to look at it? Can it be easier to use?</b></p>
        <p>However, I wasn't striking a good balance between inluding the information necessary to have a clear interface, and trying to be as minimal as possible to reduce and experience friction and visual irritation. </p>
        <p>Below I am showcasing some specific changes made based on 3 more usability testing sessions, while also considering my mantras.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="testing-img1" src="images/krania_finalmockup1.png" alt="dashboard intro" id="krania">
      <div class="testing-text1">
        <p> <b> On clarifying hierarchy: </b> </p>
        <p>I found that people were <b>consistently confused when they landed on this page.</b> They weren't sure where to look, or what they were looking at. </p>
        <p>I therefore tried to use color and size to increase the clarity and hierarchy of information. As headache and migraine logging would be the most common activity when one lands on this page, I tried to make that choice clearer. </p>
      </div>
      <img class="testing-img2" src="images/krania_finalmockup2.png" alt="document exit" id="krania">
      <div class="testing-text2">
        <p> <b> On better feeback: </b> </p>
        <p>It seemed like people were <b>not sure when they finished logging,</b> or if it was a bug that they were led back to the dashboard. They just weren't sure that they actually logged their information. </p>
        <p>This was one of those instances where I tried to avoid making extra screens in order to decrease friction, but ended up sacrificing clarity. I created a success page to reinforce that a log was finished, but perhaps this could be a modal. Point is that feedback helps.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="testing-img3" src="images/krania_finalmockup3.png" alt="document feedback" id="krania">
      <div class="testing-text3">
        <p> <b> On increasing information input: </b> </p>
        <p>I realized that I was not being <b>empathetic about the various types of headaches and migraines that people experience.</b> I actullay didn't have this screen in my first high fidelity version. </p>
        <p>As this is valuable information for the user to keep track of, I realized I needed to add this input section to the flow in order to more accurately track various sorts of pain. </p>

        <h2> Reflections </h2>
        <p> Below are some thoughts as I look back on the project. I wanted to make sure to I could quantify the exact takeaways, so I can have them readily available for future projects. <p>

          <h3>What Worked</h3>
            <p><b>Having design mantras.</b></p>
            <p>The fact that I could go back to two mantras continuously throughout my designing phase was very helpful. When I got stuck in making a decision, I would just reference the mantras. Is this visual or work REALLY necessary? Is this experience as simple as it can possibly be? These north stars drove me to try to make the most valuable decision I could make at that moment. </p>
          <h3>What Didn't Work</h3>
            <p><b>Making assumptions about what people might find irritating in the experience.</b></p>
            <p>I had decided for myself that the simpler this design was, the better. I was therefore very frugal with my copy, visuals, and feedback. I was so frugal that the experience suffered, and aspects of it were unclear since people just didn't have the feedback they're used to having. </p>
          <h3>If Given More Time</h3>
            <p>I would love to consult with medical professionals that either treat or study headache and migraines, so I could make more medically informed desing and experience decsions. I feel like that was a perspective I was certainly lacking in this experience.</p>
