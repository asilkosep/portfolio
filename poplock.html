       <h2>Overview</h2>
         <h3>Problem</h3>
           <p>New York is home to a plethora of urban dance classes, workshops, and showcases happening on any given day. However, discovering these events can be difficult and requires searching through a variety of different platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, individual studio websites, etc.</p>
         <h3>Solution</h3>
           <p>Poplock seeks to simplify the process by providing a single platform by which dancers can discover local dance events in New York, and by providing a hosting platform for teachers/organizers to get the word out about their events. </p>

         <p>Before starting the project, I did a bit of informal “user surveying” to gauge if people had similar frustrations, and lo and behold, they did! As I already had this community of dancers, I deployed the survey to them and received some great feedback. </p>

Another frustration is having to look through studio websites to discover new classes, with little information about the classes on the websites.

        <p>Sketching out these wireframes was different than how I’ve sketched before, as my plan for this product was to make a native app, which meant designing directly for the phone where I am used to designing more so for responsive websites. And so the learning commenced! I also had the added challenge of determining how to structure this app to be a product that looks very similar to both student and teacher users, with only slight variations in experience for the teachers, having the ablity to post an event. This decision came out of discussion with dancers as well as developers, and deciding that we don't want to make the experiences for the two user sets different, as we want to emphasize the idea of one community and level the playing field. </p>

          <p>Stongly considering the demographics of my users, I pulled visual inspirationg from the younger urban streetwear style. With this in mind, I structured a mood board consisting of streetwear, streetwear brands and clothing styles typically associated with urban youth, as well as the street dance culture. Brands like Adidas and Nike were at the forefront, providing a basis for branding competition. Pulling from the clean aesthetic that these brands provide, mixed with the bright colors of the street wear styles, the resulting brand colors, logo, and typography are clean yet fun and inviting. </p>

I really wanted the pops of color to be energetic and stand out, while also providing a clean and easy to read layout, as there would be a solid amount of text and information we're dealing with.   </p>
        <p> This dictated my decision to keep the background a clean white, with the main pops of color coming from the primary green I've chosen, with smaller details in the bright pink. </p>

    <div class="usability-testing" id="poplock">
      <h3> Usability Testing and Discoveries </h3>
      <p>The main tasks that I tested were those that we determined would be necessary for an MVP. These included:</p>
      <p><b>1. Signing up as a teacher</b></p>
      <p><b>2. Searching for a class, and adding the class to a calendar </b></p>
      <p><b>3. Adding an event posting, and editing that event posting</b></p>
      <p>One of the bigger challenges was figuring out the best dashboard experience, as well as the class posting and editing experience. Something that I tested early on was the decision to make both student and teacher flows through the app very similar, with the intention of making the development process smoother, as well as with the intention to maintain a sense of unity between both students and teachers, as often dancers end up being both.</p>
      <p>That said, the challenges in structuring that UI showed themselves. It became essential to make these flows as similar as possible, while making the teacher flows clear when needed. I made changes like adding destinations to the bottom navigation, changing around the user profile experience, and adjusting the class posting experience to fulfill the needs of the teachers. </p>
      <p>Below I am showcasing some specific changes made based on the user testing. </p>

      <p> <b> On easier accesss </b> </p>
      <p>When interviewing both students and teachers alike, I was getting similar feedback on easier access to function. </p>
      <p>Here I've integrated the ability for a teacher edit their classes directly from their calendar, avoiding an extra step. </p>

    <div class="testing-text2">
      <p> <b> On better feeback </b> </p>
      <p>Something people mentioned was seeing what criteria they had used to search, and having the option to easily edit that criteria. </p>
      <p>Referencing back to Material Design Guidelines, one way to show search criteria is to use the chip labels which have the "x" option to easily broaden search.</p>

    <div class="testing-text3">
      <p> <b> On reinforcing information </b> </p>
      <p>A few users mentioned that they wanted to see feedback about their work being saved. I initially did not have anything to show or tell the user that their work is safe. </p>
      <p>I therefore added copy in a highlighted color that says “all changes have been saved” to assure the user all is safe. </p>

      <p> Below are some thoughts as I look back on the project. I wanted to make sure to I could quantify the exact takeaways, so I can have them readily available for future projects. <p>

        <h3>What Worked</h3>
          <p>Usability testing worked all the way.</p>
          <p>Any time I wasn’t sure about an aspect of the UX or the design, a round of testing cleared up those questions.</p>
        <h3>What Didn't Work</h3>
          <p>Not following Material Design Guidelines right away. </p>
          <p>I was floating somewhere in between, and only later in the mock ups phase realized that I was using material components, but not always properly. If using the components, I figured I should commit to the guidelines and really read the literature. Needless to say I learned quite a bit about bottom navigations and buttons. </p>
        <h3>If Given More Time</h3>
          <p>I’ve given this answer for other projects, but I would test more users. There’s SO much insight to gain from the people that would eventually be using the product, and it helps to get out of my own design bubble as much as possible.</p>
