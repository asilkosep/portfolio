        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>I was brought on to create a fresh and new example of cloud storage that would be competitive to the existing platforms. This would mean providing necessary features, but also adding features that would carve out space in the market for the new proposed platform.</p>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>I proposed to create a cloud storage platform catering to students and professionals that create, take a lot of notes, and collaborate. Atmosphere is a platform that organizes your work in three distinct workspaces: a space for all of your various documents and uploads, a space to take and organize your notes, and a space to organize teams and team documents, with the ability to collaborate in real time. The idea is to offer a simple one stop shop with no frills, focusing on making the UI a peaceful and clutter free space that can help clear your brain and help you focus on what really matters. I’m working off of the principle of a clear space producing a clear mind. </p>

        <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
          <p>Preference testing is a lovely tool. I am one designer, the but the hope is that there would be users a plenty, so what a useful tool to get their opinions on design considerations to make sure the product fits THEM best? </p>
          <p>Below are some “before and afters” showcasing design decisions based on preference testing.</p>

      <div class="testing-text1">
        <p>Upon sign up, I was leading people straight into a dashboard that already container docuemnts, and that confused most testers. </p>
        <p>In the revision, I included a “welcome” dashboard that didn’t contain anything yet, simulating the actual experience. </p>

        <p>During the usability test, people found that there was not escape from this screen (and this actually came up once more in another scenario. </p>
        <p>I went back and added exit strategies, such as and “x” at the corner.</p>

      <div class="testing-text3">
        <p>A few users mentioned that they wanted to see feedback about their work being saved. I initially did not have anything to show or tell the user that their work is safe. </p>
        <p>I therefore added copy in a highlighted color that says “all changes have been saved” to assure the user all is safe. </p>

        <h2> Reflections </h2>
        <p> Below are some thoughts as I look back on the project. I wanted to make sure to I could quantify the exact takeaways, so I can have them readily available for future projects. <p>

          <h3>What Worked</h3>
            <p>What really worked throughout the development of this project is setting a clear goal for the user interface as well as the experience.</p>
            <p>When I established a compass for how I wanted to users to experience the product, it made the visual and experience design processes that much easier. Not to say that the process was easy necessarily, but it helped to have that compass to come back to any time I made a decision or a change.</p>
            <p>I learned a ton about high fidelity mockup design as I worked through the mock up portion of the project. As I was laying out my landing page, for example, I iterated a number of times to create the most comprehensive experience. I learned to observe other landing pages, listen to the users I was testing, as well as professionals critiquing my designs. In the past I have worked primarily on my own, with little feedback. I like that the nature of the process is heavily iterative, and knowing that the ability to iterate will yield the best results.  </p>
          <h3>What Didn't Work</h3>
            <p>Making assumptions that were not backed by research, as can be assumed, did not work. There were certain design decisions that I implemented and was quite set on, such as layout and color, but as soon as I started preference testing and submitting my work for critique, it was clear that my designs were sometimes too extreme on the side of minimal that I thought looked great, but users felt looked incomplete or unclear. </p>
          <h3>If Given More Time</h3>
            <p>I would have spent more time on research. I would seek out more people to take the survey to better gauge what the demographic was lacking in the existing products. I would have loved to spend more time usability testing as well, as I found that I learned so much and gained unique insights from each usability test, so I imagine if I kept going I could have dug deeper into improving the user experience. The best product is simply the one that users enjoy most, so diving deeper into research and getting a better understanding of the user seems like the ultimate way to provide for the user. </p>
