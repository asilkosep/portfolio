          <div class="boxes-text">
               <p>I believe my interest in design showed itself with an early fascination for packaging/boxes and containers. Yes indeed, that is what fascinated me. I loved interesting boxes, and all the different ways people managed to contain something. I would collect the ones I thought were most interesting, try to recreate them, and then started using them as building blocks for making furniture for my stuffed animals and dolls. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="dance-text">
              <p> As I continued with a fascination with boxes, growing into a fascination with furniture, and products of all kinds, really, I grew to be deeply intrigued by America’s Best Dance Crew (a televised urban dance competition). It catapulted me into discovering urban dance later in life. Dancing now continues to be my way of releasing and expressing. It can be anxiety inducing and relieving all at once, but that's a sign to me that I should keep doing it. Developing and staging choreography is a product design process of its own. Our set choreography is a product that we create by conducting research, ideating, wireframing and prototyping, then iterating on our designs.</p>

            <h2> Part 3: IDEO and Design </h2>
          </div>
          <div class="idea-text">
            <p>Enter: Lisa as a sophomore in high school.
            They tell me, "choose a major, young grasshopper." Sure thing, omnipresent? voice. The only thing that really pulled me in was the Industrial Design major. I went to a technical high school, so everything else was rather technical and non-creative. I learned that this was a way to do "practical art." Perfect, I get to express myself and make interesting products. It was a go! From there I started to learn about form and materials, sculpture and creative problem solving. The first project we did in class was make a chair, a chair someone can sit on, out of a set amount of cardboard. This was it, I had landed in the right place. I’ve been preparing for this my whole box-loving childhood!</p>
            <p> How is IDEO involved? Well, one of my teachers put on a video about what IDEO does, and I’m thinking, there are places out there that do THAT? Creatively solve problems, <b> all day </b>? This was fantastic news. He proceeded to show a video on Apple’s design principles, and I quote that video to this day (to the dismay of my partner, who’s now fed up with my personal design analysis TED talks). </p>

          </div>
          <div class="coffee-text">
            <p>Thanks for still being here...</p>
            <p> To tie this all together, art and dance have always been my ways of visualizing music, and I found that design does that for everything else. It is a storytelling tool, I want to use that tool to tell stories, help others on their journey, or maybe just make them feel that bit of emotion when they see something I’ve designed. As its left its mark on me throughout the years, as I am a collection of all of the design I have seen and felt and soaked up, I want to share those experiences and keep making more. That can be an app that can help someone in their recovery journey, or help them build the thing they’ve always wanted to build. Good design is a powerful tool - and I will keep practicing the use of various perspectives in design to create powerful products.</p>
